"""what we learn is to create filtered list comprehension 


syntax = [new item for item in iterable for condition]
what it does is it iterates each element through loops and filter if the if condition is true
"""


"""
new_item (which is n) takes the current value from the loop.
If that value is even, it gets added to the list evens.
